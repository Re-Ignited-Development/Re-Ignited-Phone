# Notes

-**You need to ensure the resource is started before your jobs otherwise features that interact with them may not work.**

-**The following should remain false`"useWebRTCVocal": false` as it doesn't work with onesync anymore.**

-**You need [Screenshot Basic](https://github.com/citizenfx/screenshot-basic "Screnshot Basic") to take selfies/photos. Otherwise, set `"enableTakePhoto": true,` to `false`**
